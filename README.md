#   Knights Adventure





## Features Implemented

1. File Reading and Saving  
   Program data is stored in CSV files, that will be read at the launch of the program. There
   should also be the feature to save the current progress of the knights. There are both
   default files, and the ability to pass in files via the command line. 
2. Knights  
   Knights gain experience defeating monsters, and there can only be four active knights on a quest at a time. 
3. Fortunes / Bonus Cards  
   Before knights start a quest, a random fortune is assigned to them. This fortune provides bonuses or even
   minuses if the fortune is bad. 
4. MOBS / Monsters  
   Knights will have random encounters with 1-4 monsters (depending on the number of active knights).
5. Team Management  
   When not on a quest, players should be able to view information on each knight, and manage their
   active knight pool. Knights never "die", they are just defeated and return to the normal pool.
6. Text-based game  
   For now, the entire game is text based to the System console (System.out / System.in), however, it has been designed to be built
   in a way that can easily be replaced. 

The above is just for the general picture, and what is given to game developers to work with.

## Sample Output

What would you like to do? help
Unsure what to do, here are some options:
	ls or list all  - listing the knights
	list active  - list the active knights knights only
	show name or id - show the knight details card
	set active name or id - set knight as active (note: only 4 knights can be active)
	remove active name or id - remove a knight from active status (heals knight)
	explore or adventure or quest - find random monsters to fight
	save filename - save the game to the file name (default: saveData.csv)
	exit or goodbye - to leave the game

Game rules: You can have four active knights. As long as they are active, they won't heal, but they can gain XP by going on adventures.
When you make a knight inactive, they will heal. How many monsters can you defeat before, you have to heal?
